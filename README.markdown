## Another drag and swipe library?

This project is an example of basic drag & drop and swipe-to-dismiss with `RecyclerView` using `ItemTouchHelper`. It corresponds with an article series found here:

[Drag and swipe with RecyclerView](https://medium.com/@ipaulpro/drag-and-swipe-with-recyclerview-b9456d2b1aaf)

The classes in [co.paulburke.android.itemtouchhelperdemo.helper](https://github.com/iPaulPro/Android-ItemTouchHelper-Demo/tree/master/app/src/main/java/co/paulburke/android/itemtouchhelperdemo/helper) can easily be used in other projects.

Download the apk from [releases](https://github.com/ipaulpro/Android-ItemTouchHelper-Demo/releases).
